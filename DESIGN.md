SamSocial is a web application designed to create a seamless connection between users and service organizations, providing a platform for discovering volunteer opportunities and engaging with community-focused initiatives. The design of SamSocial emphasizes scalability, security, and maintainability, while ensuring a user-friendly experience for individuals and organizations alike. This document outlines the technical architecture and design decisions that power the application.

The backend of SamSocial is built with Node.js and Express.js, which provide a lightweight and efficient framework for server-side development. MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database, serves as the primary data store, enabling the application to handle diverse data models with ease. Mongoose is used as the object data modeling (ODM) library, simplifying schema definitions and database interactions. This combination of technologies ensures that the application is both performant and easy to extend as new features are added.

The database is organized into collections for users, organizations, posts, and listings. The user collection stores data such as usernames and hashed passwords. The organization collection includes information about each organization, such as its name, description, and associated posts and listings. The post collection tracks content created by organizations, including titles, descriptions, and images. The listings collection stores data such as event name, description, time, date, etc. Relationships between these collections are managed through references, enabling efficient querying and data retrieval.

Routing in SamSocial is handled in a modular fashion, with each feature having its own dedicated route file stored in the `routers` folder. For example, the `users.js` file contains routes for user authentication, while the `orgs.js` file manages organization-related routes. Each route file imports logic from the `controllers` folder, where the core functionality for database queries, data processing, and response handling is implemented. This separation of concerns ensures that the application remains organized and easy to maintain.

The frontend is rendered using EJS templates, which allow dynamic content to be displayed server-side. EJS-Mate is used to manage layouts and partials, enabling reusable components such as the navigation bar. This approach streamlines the development process and ensures a consistent design across the site. Styling is handled with Bootstrap and CSS.

Authentication in SamSocial is implemented using Passport.js, which provides a secure framework for user login and session management. Passwords are hashed before storage, ensuring that sensitive user data remains protected. Middleware is employed throughout the application to enforce authentication requirements and handle errors gracefully. Error handling is centralized, with utilities like `catchAsync` and `expressError` ensuring that exceptions are caught and displayed to users in a meaningful way.

The design decisions behind SamSocial prioritize scalability and future growth. For instance, MongoDBâ€™s schema-less nature allows for easy expansion of the database structure to accommodate new features. The modular routing and controller architecture make it straightforward to add or modify functionality without disrupting the existing codebase. In the future, SamSocial could be extended with real-time notifications, a chat system, or a shift to a single-page application architecture using React or Vue.js to further enhance user experience.

Overall, SamSocial combines modern web technologies with a carefully considered architecture to deliver a powerful and user-friendly platform for connecting with service organizations. Its modular design and scalable infrastructure ensure that it will continue to meet the needs of its users and grow alongside their expectations.
